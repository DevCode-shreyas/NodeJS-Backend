Question 1: Difference Between MongoDB Server & Node.js Server

Answer:

 The MongoDB server is responsible for storing and managing data in the MongoDB database. It handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations. On the other hand, a Node.js server is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code. It handles incoming requests from clients, processes them, and can interact with databases like MongoDB to retrieve or update data. You would use a MongoDB server to store and manage data, while a Node.js server is used to handle application logic and serve client requests.

Question 2: MongoDB Queries

a) Write a MongoDB query to create a new document in a collection named "students" with fields "name," "age," and "grade."

b) Write a MongoDB query to update the "age" field of a document in the "employees" collection with the name "John" to 30.

c) Write a MongoDB query to delete a document from the "products" collection with the name "Product A."

d) Write a MongoDB query to retrieve all documents from the "orders" collection where the total amount is greater than $100.

*/

db.students.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 20, grade: "A" });

db.employees.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 30 } });

db.products.deleteOne({ name: "Product A" });

db.orders.find({ totalAmount: { $gt: 100 } });

Question 3: SQL vs. MongoDB

Explain the main differences between SQL databases and MongoDB in terms of data structure, querying language, and use cases. Provide examples of scenarios where you might choose one over the other

Answer:

 SQL databases use structured tables with rows and columns to store data, while MongoDB uses flexible and dynamic documents in collections. SQL databases use SQL as a querying language, while MongoDB uses a JavaScript-like syntax for queries. SQL databases are suitable for applications with well-defined and structured data, such as financial systems. MongoDB is better for projects with changing or unstructured data, like content management systems or real-time analytics.

Question 4: Query Comparison

Compare and contrast the following MongoDB and SQL queries for retrieving data:

a) MongoDB: db.products.find({ category: "Electronics" }) 
SQL: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = "Electronics"

b) MongoDB: db.users.findOne({ username: "Alice" }) 
SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "Alice"

c) MongoDB: db.orders.aggregate([{ $group: { _id: "$status", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }]) 
SQL: SELECT status, SUM(amount) as total FROM orders GROUP BY status


Answer:

a) Answer: Both queries retrieve products with the category "Electronics."

b) Answer: Both queries retrieve a user named "Alice."

c) Answer: Both queries calculate the total amount of orders grouped by status
